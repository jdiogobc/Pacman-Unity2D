# Pacman Unity2D Test

This was a 5-day project for a job entreview, I tried to make the code somewhat clear but if you need some help feel free contact me.
Some details in the game are not fine-tuned to mimic the original perfectly.

I used information from:

-http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior

-http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php?print=1

And inspired my work in:
